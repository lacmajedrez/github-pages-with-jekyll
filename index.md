##### Computational Scientist | Applied Mathematician | Industrial Postdoctoral Fellow | AI Researcher | Bridge Builder

### Bio

I am a Computational Scientist and Applied Mathematician with a demonstrated history of working as a researcher in Academia,  Government Research Centers, and (more recently) Industry. I love being part of interdisciplinary teams that focus on solving problems whose solutions benefit our society.  I am also a bridge builder that works to empower the communities I belong to by starting or organizing programs, mostly in the form of events. 

Currently, I work as an Industrial Posdoctoral Fellow at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/) (UBC), Vancouver campus, in Prof. [Eldad Haber's](https://sites.google.com/site/ehaberubc/home) group. As part of my posdoc, I collaborate with the company [Computational Geosciences, Inc](https://www.compgeoinc.com/) as a member of their Artificial Intelligence reserch team.  My project focuses on exploring convolutional neural network approaches for aquifer prospectivity mapping.  

I hold a Ph.D. in Geophysics and Applied Mathematics from UBC, a M.Sc. in Computing and Industrial Mathematics from the [Mathematics Research Center](https://www.cimat.mx/en) (CIMAT), and a B.Sc. in Computational Mathematics from the [University of Guanajuato](http://www.demat.ugto.mx/).  Prior to earning my doctoral degree, I worked for 5+ years as a (C++) software developer at CIMAT. Throughout my studies, I conducted 5 internships at various research institutions in USA and Spain, including Lawrence [Berkeley](http://crd.lbl.gov/) and [Livermore](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc) National Laboratories.

### Research interests

I conduct research in _how to design and apply numerical methods_ in the following topics:
* _convolutional neural networks_ for aquifer prospectivity mapping. 
* _upscaling and multiscale methods_ to simulate large-scale geophysical electromagnetic forward and inverse problems in 3D. Applications of this research occur in the detection and characterization of mineral deposits and petroleum reservoirs. 
* _mimetic multiscale methods_ for efficient simulation of electromagnetic fields in geophysical scenarios that include metallic-cased boreholes and fractures filled with conductive/resistive fluids.  Applications of this research occur in the context of Hydraulic fracturing.  

My most relevant areas of expertise are:
  - Partial differential equations (PDE's) (Maxwell's equations)
  - PDE constrained optimization
  - Discretization of PDE's (finite volume, finite element)
  - Sparse linear algebra
  - Numerical upscaling methods
  - Mimetic Multiscale (finite element and finite volume) methods
  - Geophysical electromagnetic forward and inverse problems 
  - Large-scale computation (high performance computing)
  - (More recently) Convolutional Neural Networks
