Bio

I am a Computational Scientist and Applied Mathematician with a demonstrated history of working as a researcher in Academia, Government Research Centers, and (more recently) Industry. I love being part of interdisciplinary teams that focus on solving problems whose solutions benefit our society. I am also a bridge builder that works to empower the communities I belong to by starting or organizing programs, mostly in the form of events.

Currently, I work as an Industrial Posdoctoral Fellow at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver campus, in Prof. Eldad Haberâ€™s group. As part of my posdoc, I collaborate with the company Computational Geosciences, Inc as a member of their Artificial Intelligence reserch team. My project focuses on exploring convolutional neural network approaches for aquifer prospectivity mapping.

I hold a Ph.D. in Geophysics and Applied Mathematics from UBC, a M.Sc. in Computing and Industrial Mathematics from the Mathematics Research Center (CIMAT), and a B.Sc. in Computational Mathematics from the University of Guanajuato. Prior to earning my doctoral degree, I worked for 5+ years as a (C++) software developer at CIMAT. Throughout my studies, I conducted 5 internships at various research institutions in USA and Spain, including Lawrence Berkeley and Livermore National Laboratories.
